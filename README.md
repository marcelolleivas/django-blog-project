# Blog project with Django
This repo was made following [Jon Code Br video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0pVZmw_pJU&t=12997s).

#### Local installation
Thinking about controlling Python and the another dependencies version, I'm using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/). Please install it to continue the following steps.

Firstly, create the virtual environment:
````
poetry shell
````

With your virtual environment working, you should install the project dependencies:
````
poetry install
````

#### Tests
For running the tests:
````
pytest
````
